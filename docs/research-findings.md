# Research Findings: Debt Strategies & Integration Patterns

## 1. Debt Repayment Strategies

### 1.1 Debt Avalanche Method

**Principle:** Pay off debts with the highest interest rates first

**Algorithm:**

1. Make minimum payments on all debts
2. Apply extra payments to debt with highest APR
3. When highest APR debt is paid off, move to next highest
4. Continue until all debts are eliminated

**Benefits:**

- Mathematically optimal (saves most on interest)
- Reduces total repayment time
- Best for financially disciplined users

**Implementation Considerations:**

```typescript
interface AvalancheCalculation {
  sortDebts: (debts: Debt[]) => Debt[]; // Sort by interest rate DESC
  allocatePayments: (budget: number, debts: Debt[]) => PaymentAllocation[];
  calculateSavings: (debts: Debt[]) => InterestSavings;
}
```

### 1.2 Debt Snowball Method

**Principle:** Pay off smallest balance debts first

**Algorithm:**

1. Make minimum payments on all debts
2. Apply extra payments to debt with smallest balance
3. When smallest debt is paid off, move to next smallest
4. Continue until all debts are eliminated

**Benefits:**

- Psychological wins (quick victories)
- Builds momentum and motivation
- Better for users who need encouragement

**Implementation Considerations:**

```typescript
interface SnowballCalculation {
  sortDebts: (debts: Debt[]) => Debt[]; // Sort by balance ASC
  allocatePayments: (budget: number, debts: Debt[]) => PaymentAllocation[];
  trackMilestones: (debts: Debt[]) => Milestone[];
}
```

### 1.3 Custom Strategy Considerations

- Allow users to drag-and-drop debt priority
- Hybrid approaches (e.g., pay small debts under $500 first, then avalanche)
- Factor in psychological preferences
- Consider promotional rates and balance transfer deadlines

## 2. Interest Calculation Methods

### 2.1 Credit Card Interest (Daily Compound)

```typescript
// Daily periodic rate = APR / 365
// Daily interest = balance * daily rate
// Monthly interest = sum of daily interests

function calculateCreditCardInterest(
  balance: number,
  apr: number,
  daysInMonth: number
): number {
  const dailyRate = apr / 365;
  let totalInterest = 0;
  let currentBalance = balance;

  for (let day = 0; day < daysInMonth; day++) {
    const dailyInterest = currentBalance * dailyRate;
    totalInterest += dailyInterest;
    currentBalance += dailyInterest; // Compound effect
  }

  return totalInterest;
}
```

### 2.2 Loan Interest (Simple Interest)

```typescript
// Monthly interest = (balance * annual rate) / 12
// Principal payment = total payment - interest

function calculateLoanPayment(
  balance: number,
  apr: number,
  monthlyPayment: number
): PaymentBreakdown {
  const monthlyInterest = (balance * apr) / 12;
  const principal = monthlyPayment - monthlyInterest;

  return {
    interest: monthlyInterest,
    principal: principal,
    newBalance: balance - principal
  };
}
```

## 3. Bank Integration (Plaid) Best Practices

### 3.1 Security Considerations

- Never store bank credentials
- Use Plaid's secure token exchange
- Implement webhook verification
- Regular token rotation

### 3.2 Data Sync Patterns

```typescript
interface PlaidSyncStrategy {
  // Initial account linking
  linkAccount: async (publicToken: string) => Promise<Account>;

  // Periodic balance updates
  syncBalances: async (accessToken: string) => Promise<Balance[]>;

  // Transaction history for payment verification
  syncTransactions: async (
    accessToken: string,
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  ) => Promise<Transaction[]>;

  // Webhook handling
  handleWebhook: async (webhook: PlaidWebhook) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### 3.3 Error Handling

- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handle ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED errors
- Graceful degradation when bank connection fails
- User notifications for connection issues

## 4. User Engagement Patterns

### 4.1 Gamification Elements

- Progress bars and milestone celebrations
- Debt-free countdown timers
- Achievement badges (First debt paid, 25% progress, etc.)
- Streak tracking for consistent payments

### 4.2 Notification Strategy

- Payment due reminders (3 days, 1 day before)
- Positive reinforcement after payments
- Monthly progress summaries
- Strategy optimization suggestions

### 4.3 Educational Content

- Interactive calculators
- "What-if" scenarios
- Tips based on user behavior
- Success stories from similar profiles

## 5. Financial Calculations Library

### 5.1 Core Functions Needed

```typescript
interface FinancialCalculations {
  // Time value of money
  presentValue: (futureValue: number, rate: number, periods: number) => number;
  futureValue: (presentValue: number, rate: number, periods: number) => number;

  // Amortization
  amortizationSchedule: (
    principal: number,
    rate: number,
    term: number
  ) => AmortizationEntry[];

  // Debt payoff projections
  payoffDate: (
    balance: number,
    rate: number,
    payment: number
  ) => Date;

  // Interest savings
  compareSavings: (
    strategy1: PaymentStrategy,
    strategy2: PaymentStrategy
  ) => SavingsComparison;
}
```
