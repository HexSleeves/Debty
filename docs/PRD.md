### **5. Technical Architecture & Stack**

The application will be developed as a modern, type-safe, full-stack web application.

* **Framework:** **Next.js (with App Router)** for a robust, server-rendered React application.
* **UI Components:** **shadcn/ui** for a clean, accessible, and customizable component library built on Tailwind CSS.
* **API Layer:** **Convex Functions** to create fully type-safe APIs between the client and server.
* **Authentication:** **Clerk** to manage all aspects of user authentication.
* **Form Management:** **Tanstack Form** for creating performant and maintainable forms.
* **Database ORM:** **Convex** will be utilized as the ORM for type-safe database access.
* **Database:** **Convex** (or a similar relational database) hosted on a secure cloud provider.
* **Bank Integration API:** **Plaid** for secure connections to user bank accounts.

### **6. Success Metrics**

* **User Adoption:** Number of monthly active users.
* **Engagement:** Percentage of users who log a payment or track a debt at least once a week.
* **Effectiveness:** Total amount of debt paid off through the app and user-reported interest savings.
* **User Satisfaction:** App Store ratings, positive reviews, and a low user churn rate.

### **7. Out of Scope (Future Considerations)**

* Comprehensive budgeting tools (income tracking, spending categories).
* Investment tracking and management.
* Credit score monitoring and reporting.
* Direct bill payment from the app.
* Native mobile applications (the initial product will be a responsive web app).

### **8. Prompting Guide for Claude**

To ensure the best results when using this PRD to generate code or other artifacts with Anthropic's Claude, please follow these guidelines:

* **Be Specific:** When requesting code, refer to the specific `ID` from the feature tables. For example: "Generate the React component for user story UX-01 using Next.js and shadcn/ui."
* **Provide Context:** Remind the model of the overall goal. For instance: "We are building a debt management app. Based on the persona 'The Overwhelmed Juggler', design the dashboard outlined in UX-01 to be as simple and encouraging as possible."
* **Iterate on Components:** Break down requests into smaller parts. Instead of asking for the entire application at once, request individual components or features. For example: "First, create the data model for 'Debt' as described in DT-01 and DT-02. Then, generate the API endpoint for adding a new debt."
* **Specify the Persona:** When asking for UI/UX suggestions or copy, specify the target persona to tailor the output accordingly. For example: "Write the onboarding copy for the 'Savvy Optimizer' persona, highlighting the advanced features like strategy comparison (PS-06)."
* **Request Elaboration:** If a requirement seems too brief, ask for more detail. For example: "Elaborate on the 'positive reinforcement' mentioned in the 'Increase Engagement' objective. What are some specific ways the app can implement this?"
* **XML Tagging:** For more precise control over the output format, you can use XML tags in your prompts. For example: "Generate the user story acceptance criteria for PS-02 and place them inside `<acceptance_criteria>` tags."
